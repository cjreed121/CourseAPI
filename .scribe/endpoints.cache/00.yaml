Emphasis is on bioclimatic and psychrometric climate analysis and its relationship to architectural design, understanding the energy exchange between body in space, the natural meaning of enclosures, and nonstructural materials and systems. The focus is on passive heating, cooling, and daylighting systems and their design. Exercises include vital sign analysis of existing spaces (thermal, air, luminous), forming hypotheses of building performance, using scientific instrumentation, tenant survey techniques, and physical modeling and simulation techniques related to daylighting and shading techniques.","when_offered":"When Offered: Spring term annually.","prereqs":"Prerequisites\/Corequisites: Prerequisites: ARCH 2370 Energy, Comfort and Ecology.
